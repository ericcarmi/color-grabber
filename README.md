simple app to get RGB and hex values for pixel at mouse location
- press left/right alt to update to current mouse position
- press ctrl + Q to close
- box position will change automatically depending on what quadrant of the screen the mouse is in

currently only working with windows via rust bindings to winapi

this picture had the mouse hovering at the bottom left of the box
